      <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Welcome! I'm Tiffany Qi, and I am a third year Business Administration major studying Business, Computer Science, and Applied Linguistics at the <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">University of California Berkeley</a>. I am pursuing a career in <strong>product management</strong> as well as in human resources and recruiting.</p>

        <p>I have discovered over the past couple of years through my many involvements on campus that I am passionate in two things: helping others and making an impact. In total, I have helped approximately 200+ students, and this number only grows by the day! <strong>I strive to make life on Earth a little easier for everyone</strong>, and it's a statement that I live by strongly. I have struggled just like everyone else, but I want to make sure there is someone there to help when something happens. I specalize in management, logistics, and planning; and as such, I take care of organizational logistics so that others can focus on what they love.</p>

        <p>I am currently President and Co-Founder of new student organization <a href="#">Computer Science Mentors</a> and previous Vice President of <a href="http://www.mcommcal.com">Marketing Community at Berkeley</a>, two Berkeley organizations that are focused in providing students with resources and tutoring opportunities to succeed at Cal and upon graduation. In addition, I spun up a project called <a href="http://ursamajor.herokuapp.com">ursaMajor</a>, which (upon completion) will provide students with the ability to plan out their four years while noting their graduation requirements! In these projects and organizations, I am focused on creating a strong base for what members do best: program, design, teach, and learn.</p>

        <p>I am also an advisor and blogger with <a href="http://www.calask.com">CalAsk</a> and <a href="http://advicefromahaasmajor.wordpress.com">Advice from a Haas Major</a>, one that provides students' with answers to all their questions, and the other is a personal project I've created that guides pre-Haas students for admission. The blog has reached 9,000 views since its creation! I am dedicated to ensuring this campus is as supported as possible, and I won't stop until every student has their questions answered.</p>

        <p>Feel free to get in contact with me through <a href="mailto:hello@tiffanyqi.com">email</a>. Scroll to learn a bit more about me!</p>

              <p>Computer Science Mentors, or CSM, is a student organization I co-founded with an experienced teaching assistant in the introductory computer science courses. I lent my knowledge of business organizations, and together, along with our executive team, we laid out the structure and foundation of CSM.</p>

              <p>In Spring 2014, there were about 600 people who took the introductory computer science course: Structures and Interpretation of Computer Programs, also known as CS 61A. In Fall 2014, the number doubled to 1200. With this many people, it is difficult to manage everyone who struggle with CS. CSM aims to create more support to students who need it, creating 200 more confident students through individualized attention. In addition, CSM will generate a community of educators through mentorships and such tutoring opportunities.</p>

              <p>As a previous graduate of this 61A, I know the difficulty of and effort it takes for a student to go through with it. I, and the rest of CSM, wants to see our peers succeed.</p>

              <p>I am a logistics expert. My role in CSM as President is to lead our executive team in the right direction, manage 10+ mentors and 40+ junior mentors, as well as ensure that our 200+ students are progressing successfully.</p>

            <p>ursaMajor is a web application that combines the flexibility of four year planning with the convenience of graduation requirements; all on one screen.</p>

            <h5>Check out <a href="http://ursamajor.herokuapp.com">ursaMajor</a>!</h5>

            <p>I am a crazy planner, with more than 10 different spreadsheets that document my productivity by time, multiple four year plans, grades, individual semester schedules, and courses. Sometimes, people reach out to me for advice about what classes to take, and when. When this happens, I go through my many spreadsheets, choose the one that best fits the person's needs, and change all the information to reflect his/her best interests. One day during finals week, a stroke of genius hit me: what if there was a web application that did this all for you automatically? And ursaMajor was born.</p>

            <p>In January, my friend and I hashed out this idea, and we reached out to student developers interested in tackling this on. It has now been a year, and we have made great strides in the app! I am extremely thankful for my current 10-person team and the progress that we have made. I am especially thankful for the project, and how it brought out my hidden product, human, and technical focus this whole time.</p>
