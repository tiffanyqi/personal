      <h1>About</h1>

        <p>Welcome to my page!</p>

        <h2>My name is Tiffany Qi, and I study Business, Computer Science, and Applied Linguistics at UC Berkeley.</h2>
        <p>I am at a third year at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> majoring in Business Administration at the <a href="http://www.haas.berkeley.edu">Haas School of Business</a>, minoring in Applied Language Studies, and hold strong interests in Computer Science as well.</p>

        <h2>I manage people and product.</h2>
        <p>I am pursuing a career in product management as well as in human resources and recruiting.</p>
        <p>I have discovered over the past couple of years through my many involvements on campus that I am passionate in two things: <strong>helping others, and making an impact</strong>; </p>


 <!--        and the key to holding all of those components together is communication. Without such communication, clients, partners, peers, and users may not understand or have the same goals as each other. I'd like to bridge the gap and share passions with everyone around me. The best way for me to do so


        <p>Why manage people and product? I have discovered over the past couple of years through my many involvements on campus that internal and external communication is the single most important factor that powers both businesses and organizations. Without that communication, clients and partners will not experience the same drive you may have towards those same goals. For me, one of the most enjoyable things in the world is to communicate internally with partners experiencing trouble to lessen their load, while at the same time communicating externally to find others with the same passions and share them together. It's the best of both worlds.</p> -->

        <h2>I strive to make life on Earth a little easier for everyone.</h2>
        <h2>I take care of the logistics so that others can focus on what they love.</h2>
        <h2>Google Calendar and Microsoft Excel are my two best friends.</h2>
        <h2>I design things!</h2>
        <h2>I'm always learning.</h2>
        <h2>I'm one of those people who is easier to reach by email than any other medium.</h2> -->


<!--         Due to my extensive desire to learn, I have pursued Linguistics, Chinese Studies, Cognitive Science, Applied Language Studies, and Computer Science. My most current (and well established interests) lies in <strong>Business, Computer Science and Applied Linguistics</strong>, and thus a combination of all three disciplines is what I plan to study for the rest of my years at Berkeley. I am a technical recruiter, peer advisor, student mentor, advocate for professional development, and a business leader. I have dabbled in computer science, internet marketing, graphic design, portrait art, advertising, and web design. I aspire to manage people and product through human resources, product, project, or program management.</p> -->

        <h2>My name is Tiffany Qi, and I strive to make life on earth a little easier.</h2>

        <p>It's a little cliche, but it's a statement I live by every day. As a workaholic, I fill up my day with countless involvements to ensure I am maximizing my learning and experience received in every given circumstance. I typically take heavy course loads in addition to my various extracurricular activities and pursuits as an undergraduate, while still maintaining important relationships despite my active lifestyle.</p>
