        h2 Human Languages
        .stats-box-text I love to learn languages! I started when I was about 8 with Japanese, then moved on to Korean and French in high school. Unfortunately, I don't consider myself fluent in any language (far from it for most). Currently, I'm focusing on improving my Mandarin Chinese and Japanese proficiency.

        h2 Programming Languages
        .stats-box-text Below is my language proficiency with a variety of back-end and front-end languages along with frameworks. I started coding in 2014, and have learning ever since. I don't believe anyone can be 100% fluent in any programming language: there's always something more to learn!
