      <h1>I'm Tiffany Qi, and I enjoy passion and struggle.</h1>
          <p>As a workaholic, it's difficult for me to <em>not</em> be doing something. I tend to fill up all my time helping other people and living up to challenges, leaving very little time for relaxation. I have high expectations for myself, and I refuse to lower those standards.</p>
      <h1>My single biggest passion is simply to help others, and I stand by this philosophy every day.</h1>

      <!-- 

      My single biggest passion is simply to help others, and I stand by this philosophy every day. Whether itâ€™s lending my cell phone to a stranger in need, or assisting a friend in making a crucial life decision; I do everything in my power to make sure those around me are satisfied; professionally and socially.

      As a workaholic, I fill up my day with countless involvements to ensure I am maximizing my learning and experience received in every given circumstance. I typically take heavy course loads in addition to my various extracurricular activities and pursuits as an undergraduate, while still maintaining important relationships despite my active lifestyle.

      Why a career in human resources? I have discovered over the past couple of years through my many involvements on campus that internal and external communication is the single most important factor that powers both businesses and organizations. Without that communication, clients and partners will not experience the same drive you may have towards those same goals. For me, one of the most enjoyable things in the world is to communicate internally with partners experiencing trouble to lessen their load, while at the same time communicating externally to find others with the same passions and share them together. Human resources is the best of both worlds.

      Head over to my blog for my thoughts on various aspects of life. Thanks for taking the time to stop by! Have a great day! -->
