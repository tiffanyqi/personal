    <h1 id="top">Correlations between Time, Grades, and More</h1>
    <p>Hi there, and welcome to my Productivity Project. Since I started college at UC Berkeley, I have been tracking my productivity through Google Calendar, then migrating the data onto a spreadsheet through a calculator application I built called <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyqi/calenTools">CalenTools</a> for the command line. With this information, I thought it wold be fun to take all this data, analyze it, and make some conclusions about how time management, grades, units, and class sizes all correlate using Google Charts. Check it out!</p>

    <p>Note: Each individual analysis isn't super in depth. My knowledge of data analysis comprises manipulation of spreadsheets and most basic statistics knowledge. As such, I am not an expert. For those who are experts and wish to buff these stats with more in-depth analyses, feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:hello@tiffanyqi.com">email</a>!</p>


    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="../../../index">Tiffany Qi</a>, and I study Business Administration at UC Berkeley. I primarily took classes in the Undergraduate Business department, but have dabbled into language-related courses, psychology, and computer science. As such, this data hinges on those specific areas, and thus is not fully comprehensive.</p>

    <p>As you can see above, I took a <em>lot</em> of classes outside of my major. I have taken 34 letter-graded classes in total, 14 of which were in my major. Next semester, this number will be 39 classes and 17 major requirements, which means I took more than half of the classes I took here were not business-related! (Of course those classes also fulfilled general education requirements, but most did not.)</p>

    <p>Something that you may not be able to see here is that I typically took heavy workloads throughout my college career, taking an average of 17.3 units at UC Berkeley per semester (where most students tend to take 15-16, or 4 classes). I took 5 classes a semester, and frequently tacked on Pass/No Pass classes (such as academic interning, computer science, breadth or teaching techniques) on top of that.</p>

    <p>I consider myself to be an above-average student. I did pretty well in the beginning of my college career, receiving GPAs well above 3.6, before I started to take my actual major requirements (where everything is curved), and my cumulative GPA has fallen consisently. However, the average GPA for a graduate at Haas is a 3.4, so my current GPA of 3.52 technically puts me above average.</p>

    <p>I am interested in these points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>whether time spent, units, or class size and grades have any correlation,</li>
      <li>whether statistics within departments have any correlation,</li>
      <li>whether grade deflation is really a concept at Berkeley,</li>
      <li>how a student's grades and academic time commitment change over time,</li>
      <li>and how a student's grades compare with the average grades of the class and of the department.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As both time and grades are a part of every analysis, I have broken down my findings into three different pieces: <strong>Time</strong>, <strong>Department</strong>, and <strong>Individual</strong> results. Over Time, shows my individual statistics over time to see if there are any changes in habits, grades, or time spent. Department refers more to comparisons within my, average class, and department statistics. Finally Individual is where I throw everything else in the end and see what they look like. But first, let's look at how I compiled this data.</p>


    <h2>My Diary: Getting Time Data</h2>
    <p>I am a Google Calendar Super User, and I am quite proud of that fact. Since November 2012, I have consistently logged my productive (and non-productive) moments of my life. As such, I am able to go back to any given day and reveal all the moments and feelings of that particular day. This improves my memory and gives me helpful insights along the way. Below are a couple of examples of a given week, one is of October 2014, while the other is more recent at December 2015, which also happened to be the week of final exams.</p>

    <img class="calendar" src="../../assets/img/work/oct14.png" alt="October 2014">
    <p>You can see that each category, class, homework, gaming, or hygiene is represented by a different color calendar. Usually I describe what I did during that period of time, and thus I am able to remember exactly what I did in a day.</p>

    <p>Each week, I calculate how much time I spend in each given calendar, further calculating statistics about each class and activity that I pursue. For this analysis, the calendar data I most use are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class</li>
      <li>Homework & Studying</li>
      <li>Jobs, Internships, & Activities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I split up each calendar and attributed it to each given category, which includes the specific class and activity. As such, I have three years and counting worth of quantifiable data on my productivity.</p>
    <img class="calendar" src="../../assets/img/work/dec15.png" alt="December 2015">

    <h2>Other Sources of Data</h2>
    <p>In addition to time, I also calculate grades very closely. This is typically a spreadsheet with every assignment and their weights to either recreate the exact percentage received at the end, or to estimate a percentage. About half of the percentages here are likely estimates. I would prefer to keep how I calculate this data private.</p>

    <p>I also have some average grades on the site as well. I went on <a href="http://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu">Schedule Builder</a>, a UC Berkeley resource, to find the average grade associate with my class and its given semester. If a particular semester wasn't given, I took a look at previous semesters, and if was a constant grade average, I used that one. If it didn't exist, I estimated.</p>

    <p>As for units and class sizes, this information was obtained on <a href="http://schedule.berkeley.edu">Schedule of Classes</a>, another official UC Berkeley website.</p>


    <!-- A NEW PART IS HERE -->
    <h2 id="time">Results Part 1: Productivity Over Time</h2>
    <p>Let's tackle the fourth point first: <em>how does a student's grades and academic time commitment change over time</em>? Here, we'll be toggling grades, units, and time commitment.</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="SemVCumulative"></div>
    <p>Erm, I definitely started sucking later in my college career. Why though? Maybe we can see where I went wrong in later analyses.</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="UnitsVGPA"></div>
    <p>In this graph, I compared the Semester GPAs with the numbers of units I took that semester (dividing it by 5 so that the overall trend fits on the GPA graph). Somewhow, there is slight a correlation between the semester GPA and the number of units taken in that semester.</p>

    <div class="graph-tall" id="SemTime"></div>
    <p>The above graph is a visual display of all the time I spent in each semester on HW (homework & studying outside of class), Class time, OH (office hours, or time asking for help), and Activities (extra-curriculars, jobs, internships--basically anything that wasn't class related). In Fall 2014, I was the least motivated academically but still spent more than half of my semester at my part-time job, tutoring, lab assisting, and spinning up a new student organization.</p>

    <p>In terms of motivation, I peaked in Fall 2014 and tried the best I could to be a productive member of student body. I still don't know how I managed to spend 1000+ plus hours in a semester. For context, if each semester is 16 weeks long, each week having 7 days and 24 hours in one day, then the duration of one semester is 24 x 7 x 16 = <strong>2,688 hours</strong> long. According to these numbers, I spent over <strong>40%</strong> of my time productively. If one assumes one sleeps an average of 7 hours a day, the percentage of time I would have spent sleeping in one semester would be a little under 30% (the real number was actually 30.6%), <strong>I spent more time working than I did sleeping</strong>. to put this into perspective, a full time job (assuming 40 hours/week) would be approximately 24% of time spent. Throughout my college career, I was productive approximately 25% to 42% of the time.</p>

    <p>So yeah, even though I was little crazy when it came to activities, the time I spent on my academics decreased. The most time I spent at all on my classes was in Spring 2013 (still a freshman in college), before steadily decreasing since. Let's compare this time commitment to academics directly to my grades then.</p>

    


    <!-- A NEW PART IS HERE -->
    <h2 id="dept">Results Part 2: Departmental Conclusions</h2>
    <p>In this section, I will be looking specifically at clumps of classes within specific departments, most of which are in UGBA, CS, Chinese, and Linguistics; the four departments with more than 3 classes in them. The other classes only have one data point, and are thus not as useful (but fun to look at!).</p>

    <div class="graph-tall" id="DeptTime"></div>
    <p>This is a graph that breaks up the time I spent on an average class in each department into HW (Homework and out of class studying), Class, OH (Office Hours), and Extra Time (time I spent before the semester preparing for the class itself).</p>

    <p>As you can see, when it came to departments in whose classes I took more frequently, most of my time was spent outside of class, doing homework or studying. With the below graph:</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="DeptGrade"></div>
    <p>Here, this is a plot of the average grade I received within a specific department, the average of all the classes I took's averages in that department, and the average of <em>all</em> the class averages in that department (source: <a href="http://projects.dailycal.org/grades/">Grade Distribution Analysis</a> by Ronald Kwan). Whew!</p>

    <p>Coupled with this graph below, this graph shows that I tend to do average with the class and the department in departments I took frequently, while my grades averaged wildly depending on what class it was for. I did better in Chinese, French, IEOR, Math, and Psych than I did in Anthro and ESPM (probably because it was P/NP).</p>

    <p>Let's dive into this possibly more deeply with the following individual statistics.</p>
