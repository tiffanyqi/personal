    <!-- ABOUT AND INTRODUCTION -->
    <h1 id="top">Correlations between Habits and Grades in College</h1>
    <p><strong>[WORK IN PROGRESS]</strong></p>
    <p>Hi there, and welcome to my Productivity Project. Since I started college at UC Berkeley, I have been tracking my productivity through Google Calendar, then migrating the data onto a spreadsheet through a calculator application I built called <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyqi/calenTools">CalenTools</a> for the command line. With this information, I thought it would be fun to take all this data, analyze it, and make some conclusions about how time management, sleep, fun, grades, units, and class sizes all correlate using Google Charts.</p>

    <p>As such, this project is an analysis of <strong>one person's life</strong>, and should not be taken as absolute fact. I found this data interesting to share, and hope that it helps you when you think that one test can make or break your grade. Check out the project below!</p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is <a href="../../../index">Tiffany Qi</a>, and I just graduated from UC Berkeley, studying Business Administration. I primarily took classes in the Undergraduate Business Administration department, but have dabbled into language-related courses, psychology, and computer science. As such, this data hinges on those specific areas, and thus is not fully comprehensive of all departments at Berkeley.</p>

    <p>I was an above-average student with a final GPA of 3.55. The average GPA at Haas is a 3.4. I did pretty well when I first started college and received a 3.8 my first semester, then it fell pretty consistently to 3.52 until my last semester.</p>

    <p>I studied a <em>lot</em> of classes outside of my major, and I typically took on heavy workloads throughout my college career. I did 42 letter-graded classes in total, 20 of which were in my major, which means more than half of the classes I took here were not business-related! Most of these classes did not fulfill general education requirements. This is an average of 17.3 units and around 5 classes per semester, whereas most students tend to take 15-16 units and around 4 classes. On top of letter-graded units, I frequently tacked on Pass/No Pass classes (such as academic interning, computer science, breadth or teaching techniques) on top of that.</p>

    <p>I spent a lot of my time on extra-curricular activities, and comprised more than half of all my productive time. I was somewhat of a workaholic, but I enjoyed these activities considerably. Thus, while I highly enjoy my activities, I classified it in my calendar as work and productivie time. For now, "fun" is defined as time set aside for something non-work related.</p>

    <p>I am interested in these points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> how a student's grades and academic time commitment change over time,</li>
        <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> whether time spent, units, specific tests, or class size and the grades received in the class have any correlation,</li>
        <li><strong>Others: </strong>whether time spent having fun, sleeping, and on activities affects GPA,</li>
        <li><strong> Deflation: </strong> and whether grade deflation is really a concept at Berkeley.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>While I took basic statistics in high school and in college, I do not have a background in data science or analysis. Thus, my analysis is limited to the lens of linear correlations and timescales. If you'd like to play with my data, feel free to <a href="mailto:tiffany19qi@gmail.com">contact me.</a></p>

    <p>I will do my best to deeply analyze the data through the eyes of one student.</p>

    <h3>My Diary: Getting Time Data</h3>
    <p>I am a Google Calendar Super User, and I am quite proud of that fact. Since November 2012, I have consistently logged my productive (and non-productive) moments of my life. (Most of Fall 2012 is an estimate of time spent except for the last two weeks of the semester.) As such, I am able to go back to any given day and reveal all the moments and feelings of the past. This improves my memory and gives me helpful insights along the way. Below are a couple of examples of a given week: one is of October 2014, while the other is slightly more recent at December 2015, which also happened to be the week of final exams.</p>

    <img class="calendar" src="../../assets/img/work/oct14.png" alt="October 2014">
    <p>You can see that each category is represented by a calendar of different colors. I describe each event with some description. Some are more obvious, such as sleep, and so many events have "No Title".</p>

    <p>Each week, I calculate how much time I spend in each calendar, further calculating statistics about each class and activity I pursue. For this analysis, the calendar data I use are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Class</li>
      <li>Homework & Studying</li>
      <li>Jobs, Internships, & Activities</li>
      <li>Job Searching</li>
      <li>Sleep</li>
      <li>Hobbies (a recent addition)</li>
      <li>Games & Time Wasters</li>
      <li>Social / Calls</li>
      <li>♥♥♥</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I split up each calendar and attribute it to each given category, which includes the specific class and activity. As such, I calculate productivity strictly from the first four calendars. I have other things like "fun", which is calcuated from hobbies, games & time wasters, and social (spending time talking or doing something with someone not work-related), and love. I have more than three years worth of quantifiable data on my productive (and not so productive) moments.</p>
    <img class="calendar" src="../../assets/img/work/dec15.png" alt="December 2015">

    <h3>Other Sources of Data</h3>
    <p>In addition to time, I also calculate grades very closely. This is typically a spreadsheet with every assignment and their weights to either recreate the exact percentage received at the end, or to estimate a percentage. I have lost specific test grades for the first four semesters. In addition, many classes do not release final exam grades, participation, or final course grades, so about half of the percentages here are likely estimates.</p>

    <p>I also have some average grades on the site as well. I went on <a href="http://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu">Schedule Builder</a>, a UC Berkeley resource, to find the average grade associated with my class and its given semester. If a particular semester wasn't given, I took a look at previous semesters, and if it was a constant grade average, I used that one. If it didn't exist, I estimated.</p>

    <p>At UC Berkeley, we use a 4.0 grading scale. In my graphs, I frequently use number representations to present results visually. This is what the specific scale looks like:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>  <td>A+ : 4.0</td> <td>B+ : 3.3</td>  <td>C+ : 2.3</td>  <td>D+ : 1.3</td>  <td>F</td>  <td>0</td>   </tr>
      <tr>  <td>A : 4.0</td>  <td>B : 3.0</td>   <td>C: 2.0</td>    <td>D : 1.0</td>                            </tr>
      <tr>  <td>A- : 3.7</td> <td>B- : 2.7</td>  <td>C- : 1.7</td>  <td>D- : 0.7</td>                           </tr>
    </table>

    <p>We also have Pass/No Pass grades, which is not represented in the GPA. I took six classes P/NP, three of which I do not have grades for. These six grades, despite being in this data, is not calculated in my GPA.</p>

    <p>As for units and class sizes, this information was obtained on <a href="http://schedule.berkeley.edu">Schedule of Classes</a>, another official UC Berkeley website.</p>

    <h3>Terminology</h3>
    <p>There are a few statistics and college terms I use throughout the project. I define them below in case something doesn't make sense:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coefficient of Determination:</strong></li>
      <li><strong>GPA:</strong> stands for "grade point average". It is a way for schools to average a student's academic achievement in a single number. The maximum GPA a student may receive at Berkeley is a 4.0</li>
      <li><strong>P/NP:</strong> stands for "pass/no pass". These grades do not factor into GPA, and students must receive at least a C- to pass the class. If a student receives a NP on a graduation requirement, he or she must retake the class. It is difficult to receive a "NP".</li>
      <li><strong>:</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Let's get started.</p>


    <!-- OVER TIME CALCULATIONS -->
    <h2 id="time">Time: How a Student's Grades and Time Commitment Change Over Time</h2>

    <h3>My Time</h3>
    <p>The below graph is a visual display of all the time I spent in each semester on HW (homework & studying outside of class), Class time, OH (office hours, or time asking for help), Activities (extra-curriculars, jobs, internships--basically anything that wasn't class related), Planning (academic, life, etc.), and Job Hunting (searching, interviewing, etc). In Fall 2014, I was the least motivated academically but still spent more than half of my semester at my part-time job, tutoring, lab assisting, and spinning up a new student organization.</p>
    <div class="graph-tall" id="SemTime"></div>

    <p>In terms of motivation, I peaked in Fall 2014 and tried my best to be a productive member of the student body. I still don't know how I managed to spend 1000+ hours in a semester. For context, if each semester is 16 weeks long, each week having 7 days and 24 hours in one day, then the duration of one semester is 24 x 7 x 16 = <strong>2,688 hours</strong> long. According to these numbers, I spent over <strong>40%</strong> of my time productively. I spent 30.6% of my time sleeping, which is approximately 7 hours a day. <strong>I spent more time working than I did sleeping</strong>. To put this into perspective, a full time job (assuming 40 hours/week) would be 24% of time spent. Throughout my college career, I was productive about 28% to 47% of the time. (The first calendar depicted a typical week in Fall 2014.)</p>

    <p>So yeah, even though I was little crazy when it came to activities, the time I spent on my academics decreased. The most time I spent on my classes was in Spring 2013 (still a freshman in college).</p>

    <h3>My Grades</h3>
    <p>Note: these graphs related to grades show up occasionally. If one or the other does not appear, please try refreshing.</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="SemVCumulative"></div>
    <p>This graph compares my semester and cumulative GPAs. Over time, it appears that my GPA fell pretty consistently until my final semester. Sometimes, huge decreases in semester GPA does not affect cumulative GPA by that much. This is due to the decrease in units taken for a letter grade, which is reflected in the below graph.</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="UnitsVGPA"></div>
    <p>In this graph, I compared the Semester GPAs with the total number of units I took that semester (including P/NP units, and dividing it by 5 so that the overall trend fits on the GPA graph). There is somewhat of a correlation, as the more number of units I take, the higher the GPA.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, my motivation peaked in Fall 2014, and fell throughout consecutive semesters. Units and grades were also slightly positively correlated. This next section will show even more correlations.</p>


    <!-- CORRELATION -->
    <h2 id="correlation">Academic Correlation: How Everything is Connected</h2>
    <p>I will be covering the following correlations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time spent and grade received</li>
      <li>Test results and grade received</li>
      <li>Number of units and grade received</li>
      <li>Class sizes and grade received</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's begin!</p>

    <h3>Time & Grades</h3>
    <p>I have had the good fortune of documenting how much time I spent going to class, doing homework and studying, going to office hours, and studying before the semester. I went to most of my classes, as most were participation based. In addition, I only went to office hours diligently for my computer science classes, so there will be some bias there. Here, I'll provide some pictorials of grade earned and each of these four factors.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVClass"></div>
    <p>This graph illustrates the relationship between the grade received and the time spent on going to class. Through a strictly linear sense, it appears that the more I went to class, the lower my GPA was. However, since there is a significant dip in the data with additional outliers, with a coefficient of determination very close to 0, I would say there is no linear correlation here. It may be the case that the more I knew about a subject and didn't go, the higher I would score. If I didn't understand something and didn't go to class, then at that point my grade would suffer. Since both these phenomena happened, it wouldn't reflect in the data.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVHW"></div>
    <p>This graph shows the relationship between the grade received and the time spent on studying and working on homework. Like in the previous case, it appears that the more I studied or did homework, the lower my grade was. However, there are significant outliers that skew this data. If the top two were removed, there is a slightly higher coefficient of determination of 0.014, but still very weak. The data is still pretty scattered however, so the above principle holds true. Thus, there is a very weak positive relationship between studying and grade received.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVOH"></div>
    <p>This graph clearly illustrates the problem between grade received and office hours. There are two clear outliers here that misrepresent a highly negative correlation between the two. With those removed, there is again a slightly positive correlation.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVExtra"></div>
    <p>Again, CS 61A! Always the outlier. The graph shows the same problem as with the previous ones between grade received and extra time spent before the semester preparing. Removing the outlier, there is again a slightly positive correlation.</p>

    <h3>Tests & Grades</h3>
    <p>Next, I'd like to explore the relationship between test results and the grades received in the class. I classified "First Test" with either the first midterm, quiz, assignment, or essay. Some classes didn't have any of these, so those I left blank. "Final Test" was either the final exam, presentation, or paper. I avoided using a final quiz if there was one, as that may have been just a normal exam. Is there a correlation between studying your ass off and getting a good grade? Let's see.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVFirst"></div>
    <p>This first graph shows the relationship between the final grade received and the first test. There seems to be somewhat of a positive relationship here, as the better I do in the first test, the better I do in the class. When the bottom two points are removed, however, the line flattens considerably.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVFinalGrade"></div>
    <p>Here is a bubble plot of the relationship between the final grade received and the final test. The darkness of the points represent how much of the final was worth in the calculation of the grade. There seems to be quite the positive correlation here with a coefficient of determination of 0.658, while the weight didn't seem to matter that much.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="FirstVFinal"></div>
    <p>This data is interesting in terms of whether students are able to improve from the beginning to the end of the semester. Currently, the graph shows a positive correlation between the first and final exam with a 0.297 coefficient of determination, higher than most of our other data. However, when several outliers are removed from the cluster, it lowers the coefficient of determination significantly.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="FinalVFinalTime"></div>
    <p>This graph shows the relationship between how much I received on the final test and how much I spent studying for the final exam. The data is spread out everywhere, with no linear correlation in sight.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVFinalTime"></div>
    <p>This shows the relationship between how much I studied for the final exam and how much I actually received in the class. The darker the color, the greater weight the exam held in final grade determination. Unfortunately, like in the previous graph, there doesn't seem to be a correlation between studying hard in one test and the grade received.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVFinalPercent"></div>
    <p>Here shows the relationship between my grade and how much the final is worth. Doesn't seem to be a correlation.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="AvGradeVFinalPercent"></div>
    <p>As for the relationship between the average grade of the course and how much the final is worth, there also doesn't seem to be a correlation.</p>

    <h3>Units, Class Sizes, & Grades</h3>
    <p>The next set of factors include how many units the class offered, and how big the class was in determining the final grade.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="UnitsVGrade"></div>
    <p>This graph represents units and the final grade. There doesn't seem to be any correlation.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="UnitsVAvGrade"></div>
    <p>And with the average grade compared to units, again there doesn't seem to be any correlation.</p>
    
    <div class="graph-square" id="GradeVSize"></div>
    <p>It appears that there is a weak negative correlation between class sizes and the grade received, as when the bigger the class becomes, the lower the grade. When I remove all the points above 300 hours, the coefficient of determination increases from 0.168 to 0.17, which still unfortunately makes this hypothesis weak.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="AvGradeVSize"></div>
    <p>This data just shows that most of the average grades, at least of the classes I have taken, are around 3.3. Not much correlation between average grade of the course and class size at all.</p>
    
    <div class="graph-square" id="UnitsVAvTime"></div>
    <p>At Berkeley, there is a saying that students must spend about 4 times as many units of the class. Thus, if one class was 4 units, then students should spend about 16 hours a week studying, going to class, office hours, etc. If this was the case, then my data should show a strong positive correlation between these two points.</p>

    <p>Removing the top two outliers, the coefficient of determination went form 0.121 to 0.226, strengthening the relationship a little bit. However, there were roughly the same amount of 3 unit courses as 4 unit courses here, and so I wouldn't say that there is a strong correlation between average time spent and units. Some 4 unit classes will be harder than others, and so there should be more time spent there.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, <strong>there is no strong correlation between grades, time spent, test results, units, and class sizes.</strong> There is potentially a split phenonmena when it comes to time spent: the more I study, the better I do, while paradoxically, the worse I do because I need to study harder to understand the material I didn't understand before. This also translates into individual midterm and final grades as well. However, there is <strong>a slight positive correlation between extra time spent preparing for a class before the semester starts and the grade in that class, as well as between final test results and the final grade in the class.</strong></p>


    <!-- OTHER TIME -->
    <h2 id="other-time">Other Time: How Fun & Sleep Affect Productivity and GPA</h2>
    <p>Now that we've explored certain aspects of how our grades turn out based on chosen factors such as how many units we take, how big the class is, or how much time we study; what about the other more human factors like having fun, sleeping, and participating in activities? I take each one in turn.</p>

    <p>Note: There are only 8 data points here, so it's harder to make conclusions from sparse data.</p>

    <h3>Fun</h3>
    <p>I calculated "fun" as time spent on my hobbies like baking or doing jigsaw puzzles, hanging out with friends and family, hanging out with my boyfriend, and wasting time like playing games and watching TV. Each of these activities are logged in their respective calendars. I didn't start a "hobbies" or "fun" section in Fall 2012, which is why I do not have any data on it. I started dating my boyfriend in Spring 2015, which is why there is a sudden spike in this category from Fall 2014 to Spring 2015.</p>

    <p>There are two questions I am interested here, and they are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does spending time unproductively result in lower results?</li>
      <li>Does having a significant other lower productivity and grades?</li>
      <li>Does "work hard, play hard" actually hold true?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I measure this mostly through the amount of time I spend. The upper three points represent the time I started dating. The following graph shows how much time I had fun in each semester.</p>
    <div class="graph-short" id="SemFun"></div>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemUnitsVFun"></div>
    <p>This graph compares how many units I take with how much time I spend not doing so. There seems to be somewhat of a negative correlation, and the times I dated are the three points in which are higher than the line, which shows that I spent more time not studying than not in the context of units. Other than that, there isn't much of a correlation.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemGradeVFun"></div>
    <p>The graph above shows the relationship between the semester grade and the time I spent on fun. There appears to be no linear correlation, with a kink in the graph. The top three points represent the times I dated, and so they were all above the trendline. All three had different GPAs, and so I wouldn't say that any of it has a correlation.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="FunVTotalAcademicTime"></div>
    <p>This next graph relates the time spent on fun with the total academic time. Removing Fall 2012, the coefficient of determination increased from 0.01 to 0.723, which is a huge jump. As such, there is a strong negative linear correlation between time on academics and time having fun. Thus, the more I had fun, the less I spent time on academics, which seemingly debunks the "word hard, play hard" mentality.</p>

    <h3>Sleep</h3>
    
    <div class="graph-short" id="SemSleep"></div>
    <p>According to this data, I slept pretty consistently throughout each semester from 800 to 900 hours of sleep. Let's look into the specifics.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemUnitsVSleep"></div>
    <p>Here is a representation of the units taken in the semester and time sleeping. There doesn't seem to be a clear correlation since data is scattered.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemGradeVSleep"></div>
    <p>Here's another representation of sleep, comparing to the overall grade in the semester. The data is pretty scattered again, and thus not much of a linear correlation.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SleepVTotalAcademicTime"></div>
    <p>Finally, this graph shows the relationship between total time sleeping and total time going to classes, studying, and going to office hours. The coefficient of determination is 0.42, which are higher than the other coefficient. This makes sense, as the more time sleeping, the less time studying.</p>

    <h3>Activities</h3>

    <p>Activities were a big part of my college experience. While I classify it as productive time, they were largely a release of stress and another way I could have fun at college. I ask the same questions here as in fun and sleep.</p>

    <p>I've written about <a href="https://advicefromahaasmajor.wordpress.com/2014/08/05/my-extracurriculars-and-past-affiliations/">my activities before Fall 2014</a>. I also interned at Go Overseas and worked part-time at Intera Growth Partners. After BCEC, BMC, and Perfect Fifth, I did a lot of teaching and tutoring in introductory computer science. I founded <a href="csmberkeley.github.io">Computer Science Mentors<a/>, an organization focused on group tutoring in all introductory computer science courses. In total, I spent 670 hours in three semesters, which is a significant portion of my activities here.</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="SemActivities"></div>
    <div class="graph-square" id="SemUnitsVActivities"></div>
    <p>This graph shows the relationship between the units I took that semester and the time spent on my activities. With Fall 2014, the coefficient of determination jumps from 0.33 to 0.72. Thus, there's actually a strong negative correlation between units taken and time spent, which makes sense.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemGradeVActivities"></div>
    <p>I also show the relationship between the GPA I earned per semester and the time spent on activities. There's an interesting strong linear correlation here, as the coefficient of determination jumps from 0.243 to 0.916 when Fall 2014 is removed. There would appear that the less I spent on activities, the better my grades became.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="ActivitiesVTotalAcademicTime"></div>
    <p>This graph shows the relationship between the time spent on activities with the time spent on academics. Again, removing Fall 2014, the coefficient of determination decreases from 0.847 to 0.793, but with these points of data, the correlation is still strong. There's a negative linear relationship between how much time I spend on activities and my total academic time. This may be because I spent a good majority of my time on it, and thus it shifts it in this way.</p>

    <h3>Planning</h3>

    <p>I'm really big on planning. I would frequently plan out my four year schedule, tear them down, and make new ones, as well as figure out best ways to represent data on Google Calendar and my multiple spreadsheets. The question is here, would it have been more effective to use this time to study more rather than to plan?</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="SemPlanning"></div>
    <p>As shown, I frequently spent more time planning in the beginning of my academic career than the end. The Fall 2012 number is actually only the last three weeks, and so I am sure I planned more throughout that semester.</p>

    <p>Perhaps this worked out this way because I was more uncertain about my future at UC Berkeley or what my records of spreadsheets would like like than later semesters when I honed my craft. Now, I automate and use the same tools, which drastically reduces the amount of time to make them.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemGradeVPlan"></div>
    <p>This graph shows the relationship between the grade I received and how much time I planned. Even if the point 3.8, 48.3 were higher, there would still have been a very weak correlation between these two.</p>

    <h3>Jobs</h3>

    <p>The potential lack of job after graduation weighed on my mind throughout college, and so I attempted to gain more experience by applying to internships, and full time opportunities my senior year. This was one of my most stressful experiences throughout college, and would like to showcase it here as well.</p>

    <div class="graph-short" id="SemJobs"></div>
    <p>Clearly I spent more time job hunting as time went on, as I felt more pressure to succeed.</p>

    <div class="graph-square" id="SemGradeVJobs"></div>
    <p>Here presents the time spent preparing for jobs and the grade I received at the end of the semester. With the top outlier removed, the coefficient of determination increases from 0.05 to 0.23, but in the opposite direction. Thus, there is a weak negative relationship between these two.</p>

    <h3>Putting it all Together</h3>
    <div class="graph-square" id="SemGradeVOtherTime"></div>
    <p>Instead of isolating each piece, now I'm curious about whether all of the time I don't spend studying combined affects grades. with the outlier removed, the treadline gooes in the opposite direction, suggesting a weak positive relationship between grade earned and the collective sum of sleep, activities, fun, jobs, and planning. As a result, I conclude that <strong>having fun, dating, sleeping, planning, and job hunting have no direct correlation with grades. Activities, however, have a strong negative linear relationship</strong>.</p>


    <!-- DEFLATION -->
    <h2 id="deflation">Grade Deflation: Does it Exist?</h2>
    <p>At UC Berkeley, grade deflation is a big thing that we stress over. The <a href="http://www.dailycal.org/2015/05/15/grade-deflation/">Daily Cal</a> wrote an article about it, and shows a graph that compares the average grades of Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and UC Berkeley. There, UC Berkeley's average grade has been consistently under their counterparts. Here, I'd like to take a different approach. <strong>Does Berkeley award lower grades than our percentages in the class?</strong> Are classes at Cal naturally more difficult? Or, do the other schools just curve everyone upwards? I can't speak very much to the last question, but I can provide my own data on the first one.</p>

    <div class="graph-tall" id="GradeVPercent"></div>
    <p>Here is a chart of all of my grades and the percentages I received from each grade. Some of them are estimated, but I did my best to ask each of my professors what I received in certain areas in case the numbers were not updated online. The blue trendline shows the correlation between these two aspects, and the coefficient of determination is 0.499, which is somewhat of a strong correlation. It is surprising that it is not stronger.</p>

    <p>If there were no grade deflation or inflation, the line should be the thicker line you see here. This was calculated by assuming the minimum points for each grade are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2.70 (B-) : 80%</li>
      <li>3.00 (B)  : 82%</li>
      <li>3.30 (B+) : 86%</li>
      <li>3.70 (A-) : 90%</li>
      <li>4.00 (A)  : 92%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And the maximum grade are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2.70 (B-) : 81.9%</li>
      <li>3.00 (B)  : 85.9%</li>
      <li>3.30 (B+) : 89.9%</li>
      <li>3.70 (A-) : 91.9%</li>
      <li>4.00 (A)  : 100%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I took the average of these points and extended the thickness. Thus, the red line encapsulates all possible grades from their percentages received if grades were given on such scale. The red points are these averages.</p>

    <p>As you can see, the majority of grades received falls under the red line, which shows that in reality, many grades are given out not by the hard set percentage, but perhaps from the curve in the class. Yes, these percentages are much lower, but classes purposefully give students a higher grade due to the difficulty of the class itself. <strong>Perhaps there isn't so much of a grade deflation as we make it to be, as professors purposefully increase grades to accomodate this.</strong></p>    

   
    <h2>What Can You Take Away From All This?</h2>
    <p>Once again, this is solely about my data, and cannot be concluded about everyone. However, a certain grade in the class isn't just because of this-or-this, there is a wide variety of factors that play into a final grade, like how much time you study, and sleep. It's about the combination of points that create a final product. From my data, there are only some linear correlations between all these factors. And it's okay if you didn't do well on one test, it's always possible to bounce back.</p>

    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>TLDR; here are the results of my research.</p>

    <p>Factors that did have a correlation:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Units and grades.</strong> The more units I took, the higher my grade. This doesn't appear to be a normal case and should not be taken seriously without experimentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Time and productivity.</strong> The longer I was at Berkeley, the less productive I was. My most productive moments peaked at Fall 2014, and continued to decrease.</li>
      <li><strong>Duration and grades.</strong> As time went on, the more my grades fell.</li>
      <li><strong>Extra time and grades.</strong> There is a slight positive correlation between extra time spent preparing for a class before the semester starts and the grade in that class.</li>
      <li><strong>Finals and final grades.</strong> There is somewhat of a positive correlation between the final test results and the final grade in the class.</li>
      <li><strong>Fun and productivity.</strong> The more time I had fun, the less time I spent studying. "Work hard, play hard" didn't hold true for me.</li>
      <li><strong>Activities and grades.</strong> There is a strong negative correlation between time spent on activities and semester GPA. The less I did activities, the better my GPA was. The less I did activities, the more units I took.</li>
      <li><strong>Activities and productivity.</strong> The more time I spent on activities, the less time I spent studying or going to class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Factors that did <strong>not</strong> have a correlation: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time and grades.</strong> There is no direct linear correlation between time spent and the grade received. It is possible that since I spent more time on a class because it was harder, and thus I didn't do as well, or that I spent more time and thus did better. Since both outcomes were possible, there was a very weak correlation between the two.</li>
      <li><strong>Tests and grades.</strong> In general, there is no direct correlation between specific test or assignment results and the final grade in the class.</li>
      <li><strong>Units, class sizes, and grades.</strong> There is no linear correlation between grades and units, grades and class sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>Fun, dating, and grades.</strong> There was no correlation between time spent having fun and grades. Nor did dating affect my GPA.</li>
      <li><strong>Sleeping and grades.</strong> There was no correlation between time spent sleeping and the grade received. The more I slept, the less time I spent studying though.</li>
      <li><strong>Planning and grades.</strong>There was no correlation between how much time I planned and the grade received.</li>
      <li><strong>Job hunting and grades.</strong>There was no correlation between how much time I spent preparing for jobs and the grade received.</li>
      <li><strong>Grade deflation.</strong> The majority of my grades received were frequently higher than the percentages received, but not lower.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These results display only a 2-way relationship between factors and grades. Again, <strong>all of these factors impact the final grades.</strong> All I can do is isolate the findings and compare them against each other.</p>
