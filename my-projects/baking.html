             Okay. Donuts. This was pretty scary for me, since I haven't managed to get dough right. I was careful this time, and it turned out so well! No one could tell the difference between mine and store bought donuts, so I'd say this was a win. I used a combination of three different recipes: <a href="https://www.blessthismessplease.com/pioneer-womans-glazed-donuts/">Bless this Mess Blog</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgWceX0-4nE">Cupcake Jemma</a>, and <a href="http://thepioneerwoman.com/cooking/homemade-glazed-doughnuts/">the Pioneer Woman</a>.

             I accidently forgot baking powder, so I decided to make two versions of the same cake! One with butter and flour, the other with applesauce, flour, baking powder, and salt.

             I wanted to try a variation of lemon meringue pie using pomelos. In my experience, every time I've baked in the oven, it turned out wheepy, so I wanted instead to chill the curd, pipe swiss meringue (which is firmer than french), and broil/blowtorch it real quick. This was the result! Some of the tips became black, but I know now to pipe evenly. <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15093/grandmas-lemon-meringue-pie/">Pie recipe</a>, <a href="https://bakerbettie.com/how-to-make-swiss-meringue/">swiss meringue recipe</a>.

             One of my coworkers love corgis, and through a recommendation of another friend, decided to make a vanilla buttercream cake with swiss buttercream in the shape of a corgi butt.

            Forgot to take a picture, but these were more consistent in size like the one in this picture. I brought empty shells to work, and then piped whipped cream during lunchtime. Since the shells were made a day before, it wasn't as crispy as when it was freshly made. <a href="https://www.aprettylifeinthesuburbs.com/simple-and-easy-cream-puffs/">Recipe</a>.

            Inspired by the Great British Bake Off. Unfortunately, the butter was not soft enough for the biscuits and so they were rolled rather than piped. Still quite tasty! <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/viennese-whirls">Recipe</a>.

            Poured the same cream puff batter from last week into a single pan, just to see what would happen. Wasn't baked for nearly long enough, and I added an extra half tsp of salt, so it turned out not as expected. Pretty with powdered sugar. <a href="https://www.aprettylifeinthesuburbs.com/simple-and-easy-cream-puffs/">Recipe</a>.

            </a><br>
            The same day, I also wanted to try the infamous 3 ingredient Japanese cheesecake. I think the cream cheese wasn't soft enough and the white chocolate hardened slightly, which gave it a slightly uneven texture. Flavor was spot on, and was better after chilling overnight in the fridge. <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/three-ingredient-japanese-cheesecake-56389916">Recipe</a>.

            For the first time, I decide to not make a cake roll this week and go for another GBBO challenge: Lemon meringue pie. Learned that to prevent the meringue from weeping, you have to place it when it's hot and chill the pie for a couple of hours. Turned alright other than that. <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/15093/grandmas-lemon-meringue-pie/">Recipe</a>.

            Finally, I decide to go with a separate recipe, this time a more Asian flair to it using an egg separation trick. So much better, also managed to keep the tops intact. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZomakfPI08">Recipe</a>.

            I want to redeem myself, so I tried again. I used the same recipe as Bake #2, and the batter was tougher than the previous week, and cracked a lot. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5653-strawberry-cream-sponge-roulade">Recipe, without the strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar</a>.

            Annoyed about the previous day's fail, I decide to try again with a sponge. It turns out a bit better, and the whipped cream was good. <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5653-strawberry-cream-sponge-roulade">Recipe</a>.

            So many things went wrong with this. First, this is a meringue roulade, which is 10x more difficult than a sponge roulade and I was just getting back into it. Second, I didn't realize that the heavy cream should be whipped (rookie mistake), which turned into this disaster.
